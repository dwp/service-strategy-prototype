              <p class="govuk-body-l">There are three types of regular payments that might be available to you while you’re looking for work.</p>
            

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">New Style Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)</h2>
              <P>You could get New Style JSA if you’re working less than 16 hours a week, are under State Pension age, and have made enough National Insurance contributions over the last 2 to 3 years. Your savings and partner’s income will not affect how much you get. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-style-jobseekers-allowance">Find out more about New Style JSA</a>.</P>
              <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Universal Credit</h2>
              <p>You could get Universal Credit if you have less than £16,000 in savings and you or your partner is under State Pension age. If you're already getting tax credits, they will stop when you or your partner applies for Universal Credit. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Find out more about Universal Credit</a>.</p>
              <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Pension Credit</h2>
              <p>You could get Pension Credit if you and your partner have both reached State Pension age and your weekly income is below £173.75 (for single people) or £265.20 (for couples). You might still be able to get it even if you have savings, have a pension or own your home. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit">Find out more about Pension Credit</a>.</p>
