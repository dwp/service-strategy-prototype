                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="uc">Who can get it</h2>
                    <p>You might be able to get both New Style JSA and Universal Credit if:</p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>you live in the UK and have a right to work in the UK</li>
                            <li>you're 18 or over (there are some exceptions if you’re 16 or 17 - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus/new-benefit-claims">contact Jobcentre Plus</a> for advice)</li>
                            <li>you’re under State Pension age</li>
                            <li>you’re not in full-time education</li>
                            <li>you’re not working at the moment, or you're working less than 16 hours per week on average, and are available for work</li>
                            <li>you do not have an illness or disability which stops you from working</li>
                            <li>you and your partner have £16,000 or less in savings between you</li>
                            <li>you have worked as an employee and paid Class 1 National Insurance contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years – National Insurance credits can also count</li>
                          </ul>

                          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="uc">If you’re getting tax credits</h2>

                          <p>If you get tax credits, they will stop if you or your partner makes a claim for Universal Credit, even if the claim is not approved. You will not be able to make a new claim for tax credits.</p>
                          <p>If your application for Universal Credit is approved, you can get an advance to help you while you wait for your first payment.</p>

                          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="uc">How New Style JSA and Universal Credit affect each other</h2>

                          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="uc">Money</h3>
                          <p>If both claims are approved, the money you get from New Style JSA might affect how much you get from Universal Credit.</p>
                          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="uc">National Insurance credits</h3>
                          <p>While you’re getting New Style JSA, you’ll be awarded Class 1 National Insurance credits. These can help towards your State Pension and other contributory benefits in the future.</p>
                          <p>If you’re only getting Universal Credit, you’ll be awarded Class 3 National Insurance credits. These only help towards your State Pension.</p>

                          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="uc">How to apply</h2>

                          <p>You'll need to apply for each benefit separately. Apply for New Style JSA first. At the end of the application, you’ll be directed to Universal Credit.</p>

                              </ul>
