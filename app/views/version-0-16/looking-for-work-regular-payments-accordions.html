                            <p>New Style JSA is a fortnightly payment if you’re available and looking for work.</p>

                              <p>To get it, you must be under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age">State Pension age</a> and be unemployed or working less than 16 hours a week.</p>

                              <p>Your savings and your partner’s income will not affect how much New Style JSA you’re paid.</p>
