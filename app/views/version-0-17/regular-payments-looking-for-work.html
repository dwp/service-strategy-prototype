            <p>The following payments are available, depending on your situation. You might be able to get Universal Credit at the same time as New Style JSA. You'll need to apply for each benefit separately.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">New Style Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)</h2>
            <P>You could get New Style JSA if you’re working less than 16 hours a week, are under State Pension age, and have made enough National Insurance contributions over the last 2 to 3 years. Your savings and partner’s income will not affect how much you get. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-style-jobseekers-allowance">Find out more or apply for New Style JSA</a>.</P>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Universal Credit</h2>
            <p>You could get Universal Credit if you have less than £16,000 in savings and you or your partner is under State Pension age. If you're already getting tax credits, they will stop when you or your partner applies for Universal Credit. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Find out more or apply for Universal Credit</a>.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Pension Credit</h2>
            <p>You could get Pension Credit if you and your partner have both reached State Pension age and your weekly income is below £173.75 (for single people) or £265.20 (for couples). You might still be able to get it even if you have savings, have a pension or own your home. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit/how-to-claim">Find out more or apply for Pension Credit</a>.</p>
