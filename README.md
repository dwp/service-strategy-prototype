# Service Strategy Prototype

## Get Financial Support Exploration

Prototype exploring the needs of people on multiple benefits. 
This prototype explores several concepts:
- Eligibility checker, MVP based on an unemployment journey.
- GOV.UK navigation, new menu changes (benefit type groupings rather than A-Z)
- GOV.UK navigation, to include frontloaded summary pages
- COVID support information

### The Team

The SCE Service Strategy team completed this work between April 2020 - March 2022.

The Service Modernisation Future State Design Team, found the same needs and pain points investigated by this team, and has since built on this work. They began to prototype concepts linked with 'Get Financial Support' and a single digital self-serve journey from February 2024.

Permission to investigate a single 'Get Financial Support' service was given at Programme Delivery Board 15th May 2024.
New concepts are in the new [SMP Concepts prototype](https://github.com/dwp/SMP-Concepts).
